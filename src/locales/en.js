  What_is_CBD: `What is CBD?`,
  What_is_CBD_ANS: `The abbreviation "CBD" comes from the term "cannabidiol". It is a
  molecule that is one of many (around 100) cannabinoids present in hemp,
  also called cannabis sativa. CBD has a large number of benefits for
  improving well-being: sleep, relaxation, pain management.`,
  Are_hemp_and_CBD_legal: `Are hemp and CBD legal?`,
  Are_hemp_and_CBD_legal_ANS: `The answer is yes. It is not obvious to the eye to tell the difference between
  a legal and illegal product, because the plants come from the same
  species. What allows you to know if your product is legal or not, it is the
  rate of THC. Indeed, only a rate below 0,3%, fixed by the European
  regulation, allows to assure the legality. For processed products, such as
  cosmetics, the rate is 0% THC. The WHO ensures the legality of hemp,
  because it does not cause psychotropic effects.`,
  Can_flowers_be_smoked: `Can flowers be smoked?`,
  Can_flowers_be_smoked_ANS: `The flowers should not be smoked. It is advisable to consume them either
  in infusions with a fatty substance. Indeed, hemp is not water-soluble. It is
  also possible to integrate them in your recipes.`,
  What_is_the_difference_between_hemp_CBD_and_cannabis: `What is the difference between hemp (CBD) and cannabis?`,
  What_is_the_difference_between_hemp_CBD_and_cannabis_ANS: `The "cannabis" family is composed of several varieties, including
  Marijuana, which has the particularity of having psychotropic effects
  (recreational cannabis). Hemp is another variety. Its difference is that it
  has only 0.3% THC. Thus, it has no psychoactive effect, contrary to the first
  variety mentioned. Thanks to this low THC content, hemp is legal, unlike
  the first mentioned variety.`,
  How_to_use_hemp_oil: `How to use hemp oil?`,
  How_to_use_hemp_oil_ANS: `To use hemp oil, it can be added to food or to a drink. What we
  recommend and what brings a more important efficiency is to put the
  drops under the tongue. The sublingual action allows a more important
  and faster effect thanks to the numerous blood vessels present in this part
  of the mouth.`,
  How_to_use_hemp_pollen: `How to use hemp pollen?`,
  How_to_use_hemp_pollen_ANS: `Hemp pollen, also called resin, can be used in two different ways: <br /><br /> in infusion: let it infuse for 10 minutes with a fatty substance such as oil or
  soy milk. This allows the dissolution of hemp which in its usual state is not
  water-soluble. <br /> In cooking: to integrate in your best recipes.`,

  title1: `All you need to know about CBD infusion.`,
  content1: `Infusing hemp is the healthiest way to use hemp flowers directly. Contrary to popular
  belief, you can buy hemp flowers without smoking them. In fact, this is prohibited by law.
  So, today, we propose you to discover the hemp flower, but also the resin and the pollen in
  the form of infusion.<br/><br />
  Thanks to its infusion, hemp shares all the benefits of its molecules, including CBD. You can
  therefore enjoy these benefits without all the undesirable effects of inhalation. We invite
  you to discover all the benefits of these infusions, as well as how to prepare them!<br /><br />
  <b>The actions of the infusion</b><br /><br />
  As in all its other forms, the intake of hemp has multiple effects that will accompany you
  according to your needs for wellness. When you enjoy a hemp infusion, the cannabinoids
  in the plant act and activate certain receptors in your body. These receptors are naturally
  present and are responsible for what is called homeostasis. This is the balance of different
  body functions, such as sleep quality, ability to deal with stress, inflammatory factors,
  muscle recovery and many others. These cannabinoids, which are molecules that CBD is
  part of, activate the receptors and kick-start this process that is naturally present in your
  body. In a way, it's like giving extra support to restart a mechanism that has become a little
  rusty and harder to start.<br /><br />
  To enjoy the benefits of hemp flowers, pollen or rocks, infusion is a very gentle and
  pleasant way. Moreover, it will meet the needs of those who like to prepare their own
  grandmotherly recipes. Today, it's Greensensitive's turn to share her recipe with you!<br /><br />
  <b>Preparing my hemp infusion</b><br /><br />
  First of all, it is important to note that this recipe is essential to benefit from the effects of
  hemp. Indeed, its molecules are not water-soluble. They need a fatty substance to allow its
  dissolution and thus its absorption.<br /><br />
  You will need three ingredients: boiling water (as for any good infusion!), hemp (in the form
  of flowers, resin or rock), a fat (honey, butter, vegetable oil, cream or milk) and as an
  option, you can also add a tea/tea bag of your choice!<br /><br/>
  Then, 4 steps of preparation await you:<br /><br />
  1. Bring a pot of one litre of water to the boil.<br /><br/>
  2. Add the fat of your choice to the water.<br /><br/>
  3. Crumble your hemp flowers, resin or rock before putting them in a tea strainer and
  then in boiling water.<br /><br />
  4. Leave to infuse for at least 15 minutes, and then just enjoy!`,
  headertitle2: `Cook your hemp`,
  title2: `Did you know that you could cook your hemp?`,
  content2: `Infusing hemp is quite common. Cooking with hemp is yet another door open to a lot of
  curiosities and experiences. Today, we decided to share with you everything about cooking
  with hemp!<br /><br />
  While hemp cake may have, for some, a direct link to what is known as "space cake", think
  again! Hemp, as in all its forms, has no psychoactive effects. You can enjoy its beneficial
  effects in your best chocolate cake. So, if you love baking or any other dish, this article is for
  you.<br /><br />
  <b>Why should I use hemp in my recipes?</b><br /><br />
  Cooking hemp allows it to be consumed without having to burn it. Thus, it is a very healthy
  way to use it for the body. You will only enjoy all the benefits of this plant.<br /><br />
  The rather earthy taste of this plant is combined with the ingredients you like best. This
  provides an alternative, especially for people who do not like the taste of hemp oil. When
  used in the right conditions, cooked hemp provides all the benefits that are also present in
  the form of oil. Only, the respect of the recipes is necessary to allow a good absorption by
  the body of its active elements. Here, we are thinking in particular of the CBD that is inside
  this plant.<br /><br />
  In addition to the already well-known benefits of CBD, it is interesting to note the presence
  of twenty amino acids that are also part of the proper functioning of our body. Like CBD,
  the contribution of these amino acids by hemp allows the reactivation of the physiological
  functions naturally present in the body. Hemp also reveals the presence of vitamins B1, B2,
  B3, B6, B9, vitamin E, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, copper, iron, zinc and
  manganese.<br /><br />
  How do I prepare my hemp recipe?<br /><br />
  The possibilities, as with many ingredients in the kitchen, are many with hemp. Our goal is
  to share with you the key tips to succeed in your recipes and enjoy the benefits of hemp in
  the best way.<br /><br />
  As for the number of hemp ingredients to include in a recipe, this is very personal. Just as
  no two people will use the same number of drops of hemp oil, no two recipes will have the
  same hemp content. It is advisable to make your first recipes with a low hemp content.
  This will allow you to adapt the dosage to your taste and needs. Starting with 15 mg seems
  correct. It can then go up to 60 mg, when you are used to hemp.<br /><br />
  When incorporating hemp, here are the key tips for successful recipes :<br /><br />
  1. Beware of the temperature: the active ingredients of hemp do not tolerate high
  temperatures. Therefore, when using hemp in dishes, always add it at the end of
  cooking when all the ingredients are well cooked. For baking, as for cakes, do not
  exceed a temperature of 320/350°.<br /><br />
  2. If you use hemp oil in your recipes, always remember to mix it with another oil.
  Indeed, the active ingredients of hemp are not water-soluble. This mixture will
  allow a better diffusion and thus absorption by your body.<br /><br />3. For salads, the oil can be used, integrated into the seasoning, while their flowers
  and resin can be crumbled for decoration.<br /><br />
  <b>En conclusion</b><br /><br />
  Hemp can be used in different ways in cooking: as oil, flower, resin or rock. In this way of
  consumption, hemp should be seen more as a superfood. Indeed, consuming hemp, and
  consequently its active ingredients such as CBD, in food will attenuate their action on the
  endocannabinoid receptors, naturally present in the body. For more consistent effects,
  prefer to consume it as an infusion (flower, resin and rock) or as oil (in our Oil Collection).<br /><br />
  Finally, when cooking with hemp, it is important to leave the details of the kitchen to
  experiment and test. Be free to make your own choices and taste hemp in different ways.

  headertitle3: `INDOOR AND GREENHOUSE`,
  title3: `Indoor, Greenhouse, what's the difference?`,
  content3: `You may have already noticed that the Flower Collection from Greensensitive offers the
  words "Indoor" or "Greenhouse" for each flavour. These are important elements that
  characterise the way hemp is produced before it is offered as flowers, resins or rocks. It is
  therefore important to understand the interests of each production method in order to
  make the best choice.<br /><br />
  Traditionally, hemp was grown outdoors like many other plants. However, technical and
  technological developments have led to new methods of improving the quality of the
  plant.<br /><br />
  <b>What is indoor production?</b><br /><br />
  Indoor production is a completely indoor planting method. Hemp is grown in completely
  isolated spaces. This allows total control of the production and therefore of the various
  characteristics required by the plant. The grower manages the humidity, light, nutrients,
  pH and ventilation. This is a complete management system that avoids external risks, such
  as weather or parasites. The advantage is also the higher yield, as production is not
  dependent on seasonality. In addition, the hemp varieties can be further selected, which
  brings optimal quality, but also new species. These varieties can then be almost THC-free
  while the cannabinoid content is enriched.<br /><br />
  Finally, indoor production creates an optimal environment for consistent quality hemp
  production.<br /><br />
  <b>What is Greenhouse production?</b><br /><br />
  Greenhouse production is again named after its mode of production. It is a plant that is
  grown in a greenhouse. It shares many of the same advantages as indoor production, since
  the grower can protect his plants from the weather and cold in the same way. However,
  this method of production has an additional advantage in that the plants are grown in the
  open ground and natural light is used. The natural light, by its intermittent presence,
  allows the hemp to grow more actively. It is a clever combination of indoor and outdoor
  planting.<br /><br />
  Producing Greenhouse hemp is ultimately about reproducing an optimal space for hemp in
  a way that is closer to its usual environment. This ensures the quality of the hemp, but also
  the control over the plant.<br /><br />
  <b>Finally, which production to choose?</b><br /><br />
  As you can see, Greensensitive offers both production methods. Our goal is to offer you a
  choice. Indeed, each of these production methods has its advantages and disadvantages.
  So we suggest that you learn about their characteristics in order to choose your flower,
  your resin or your rock.<br /><br />
  As for the "Greenhouse" plant, it has the advantage of being more respectful of the
  environment because no electricity is needed for artificial lamps. However, indoor
  cultivation allows for more precise management of the plant and therefore a higher
  quality. We leave it to you to select the product that suits you best!`,

  content4: `On the hemp market, there are a lot of different oils. It is sometimes difficult to know which oil is best for
  you and which is of good quality. We would like to introduce you to the 3 main pillars for optimal hemp
  quality and give you some tips on how to make your choice.<br /><br />
  <b>The three pillars of quality hemp</b><br /><br />
  The method of planting<br /><br />
  All hemp in the Greensensitive collections is produced in an indoor or greenhouse environment. This
  means that the plants have been harvested indoors or in a greenhouse. Both methods of plant cultivation
  have their advantages. For more information, please read the article "Indoor, Greenhouse, what's the
  difference?<br /><br />
  The method of extraction<br /><br />
  Once the hemp flower has reached its ideal size, it is cultivated by hand because it is very fragile. It is then
  dried. All this is a real goldsmith's job, because of the meticulousness that it requires. For the oils, an
  extraction process is then carried out. At Greensensitive, this is the supercritical CO2 extraction. This uses
  very low temperatures, which preserves the quality of the molecules and produces an oil known as 'full
  spectrum'. CO2 also avoids any trace of solvents.<br /><br />
  Bioavailability<br /><br />
  Let's remember that CBD, short for "cannabidiol", is one of the molecules present in hemp. However, it is
  not alone in the plant. To be active, it needs what we call the entourage effect. It can only be fully active
  when it is accompanied by all the molecules of the hemp plant. On the market, many products only
  mention "CBD" or "CBD oil". However, these are isolates with only this molecule. The beneficial effect on
  the body is therefore limited.<br /><br />
  Let's make a comparison: Calcium is highly recommended for the health of our bones. However, it is often
  forgotten that it also needs a kind of surrounding effect. Without vitamin D, provided by the sun, calcium
  does not bind in the body. This is the same process as for CBD. This is why Greensensitive has chosen to
  offer exclusively "full spectrum" products. The presence of all these molecules allows for a greater
  efficiency.<br /><br />
  <b>Tips for choosing your hemp oil</b><br /><br />
  Finding the ideal percentage of CBD<br /><br />
  First of all, it is important to note that each person is different and has a more or less active
  endocannabinoid system. Thus, the need for CBD and other cannabinoids may vary from one person to
  another, even if the search for wellness is the same. Therefore, it is always recommended to start with
  small dosages and to increase if necessary, depending on the effects obtained. Note here that you will
  never take too much hemp. If you use more oil than recommended, your body will simply eliminate, by
  natural means, the surplus that the receptors cannot accommodate. Indeed, you can see these receptors
  as containers which, if they are already filled to the maximum, will let out what is not usable.<br /><br />
  In terms of percentage, it is possible to consider 3 main categories: light dosage (5% and 10%), medium
  (20% and 30%) and high (50%). To determine the number of drops per day, according to your needs andyour morphology, we invite you to refer to the technical sheets available from the person who
  recommended the Greensensitive brand to you.<br /><br />
  Choose the composition of my oil<br /><br />
  Several types of oil exist. At greensensitive, we suggest you discover the strength of the "Full spectrum"
  which allows you to benefit from all the molecules present in hemp. You will find CBD, but also CBN and
  CBG. These last two examples are also highlighted in two of our products to act particularly on anxiety
  and sleep! Each molecule has its own particularities and advantages. They reveal their capacities thanks
  to an MCT oil base present in our entire "Oil Collection" range. The advantage of this oil is that its
  digestion does not require the action of the pancreas and the gall bladder. It is therefore absorbed very
  high in the intestine. This allows for better assimilation by the body. After all, the body consists largely of
  water. Since oil and water do not mix, it is important to ensure good absorption. MCT oil makes this
  possible.<br /><br />
  How to use my hemp oil<br /><br />
  Greensensitive Hemp Oils are available in vials with a dropper. This will allow you to calculate the number
  of drops per day and to be regular. The best use is sublingual, under the tongue. This is an area with a lot
  of blood vessels. They capture the hemp molecules and allow them to act more quickly. It is
  recommended to wait between 30 and 60 seconds before swallowing to make it even more effective! It is
  also possible to add your hemp oil to a drink or food. Once again, hemp-based products give you the
  freedom to choose how to use them, according to your tastes and desires!`,
